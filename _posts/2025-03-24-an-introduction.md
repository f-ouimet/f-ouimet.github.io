## An introduction
### Hello World! 

Hey whoever is reading this. I'm setting up a blog using [Chad Baldwin's amazing guide](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html).

With my upcoming entry in the job market (and desire to express/journal myself), I've wanted to share a kind of portfolio that groups skill showcases, personal interests and passion projects. Github Pages seemed like the best free way to do it! 

I'm currently a student in the computer science broader field, in a program specializing in embedded systems designing and programming. I'm learning a great mix of electronics and software engineering which really fits all my interests for a future career.

Thanks for reading!

### My interests

I love everything from hardware to software, computer architectures, embedded systems, the C and C++ languages, some cybersecurity stuff here and there and more!
I'm currently getting into emulation development for simple systems.

Unrelated to tech stuff, I enjoy specialty coffee in the pourover way of brewing it (I don't have 2k+ to spend on an espresso setup). Being in full control of the brew parameters and tasting the result is an amazing experience and I'll be posting about it.
I'm also a trained bicycle mechanic and will post about some of my bike-related stuff whenever I feel it's worth mentionning.
I also like playing bass guitar! I'm very amateur-ish and will not humiliate myself on the internet for free. Will be posting about music albums!
I've got a bunch of hobbies and interests changing with the seasons which I'll be sharing under a "Miscellanous" section.

P.S. I am very not a front-end dev apart from knowing what to google and some HTML/JS basics. Don't expect crazy css tricks here! The layout of this blog will stay very simple.
